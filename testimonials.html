        <h2 class="section-title">What Alfa Does For You</h2>

        <div class="alfa-infographic-cards">

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Focused on Salaried Individuals</h3>
            <p>
              Alfa primarily works with salaried professionals who want clarity, speed, and real options.
              Instead of forcing you into a single lender’s rules, we connect you with multiple banks and
              NBFCs, allowing your profile to be evaluated across institutions that actually suit your income
              structure, employment stability, and repayment capacity.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>End-to-End Loan Support</h3>
            <p>
              From the moment you express interest to the moment funds reach your bank account, Alfa stays
              involved. We do not disappear after form submission. Our team actively tracks approval stages,
              documentation checks, verification calls, and disbursal timelines so you are never left guessing
              what happens next.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Balance Transfer & Overdraft Facilities</h3>
            <p>
              If your existing loan feels expensive or restrictive, Alfa evaluates balance transfer options
              that reduce interest burden or improve cash flow. For eligible profiles, we also assist with
              overdraft-based loan structures that provide flexibility without unnecessary penalties.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Smooth Disbursal Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Loans fail when processes are fragmented. Alfa ensures that approvals, documentation,
              verification, and disbursal are handled as one continuous flow. This minimizes delays, avoids
              repeated follow-ups, and keeps the entire journey predictable and stress-free.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Strict Data Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
              Customer data is treated as a liability, not a commodity. Every document and personal detail is
              handled with strict confidentiality, shared only with regulated partners, and used solely for
              loan processing. Your information is never misused, resold, or exposed to unnecessary risk.

      <!-- ================= B] HOW WE WORK ================= -->
      <section class="alfa-process container">
        <h2 class="section-title">How We Work For You</h2>

        <div class="process-flow">

          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-icon">📍</span>
            <p>
              The process begins with your location pincode. This allows us to immediately identify which
              banks and NBFCs actively service your area. There is no benefit in applying where disbursal is
              not operational, so this step eliminates wasted applications from the start.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-arrow">⬇</div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-icon">🏢</span>
            <p>
              We then collect your company name and determine its category. Different financial institutions
              assign varying risk and interest structures based on employer classification. This step helps
              us identify which lenders are more likely to approve your loan and at what terms. For deeper
              understanding, refer to the Lenders & Policies page.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-arrow">⬇</div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-icon">📞</span>
            <p>
              Basic personal details such as your mobile number, email address, and essential profile
              information are collected next. This enables secure communication, verification coordination,
              and proper tracking throughout the loan process.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-arrow">⬇</div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-icon">📄</span>
            <p>
              Required loan documents are gathered based on your profile and lender criteria. These typically
              include identity proof, income documents, and bank statements. We ensure documentation is
              complete before submission to prevent rejections due to technical gaps.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-arrow">⬇</div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-icon">🏦</span>
            <p>
              Finally, we apply to the bank or NBFC that best aligns with your needs and eligibility. The
              selection is strategic, not random. Approval probability, interest rate, tenure flexibility,
              and disbursal speed are all considered before submission.
            </p>

        <article class="story-card hover-all-directions">
          <p>
            Most customers come to Alfa after being confused, delayed, or misled elsewhere. They expect
            another sales pitch and instead find structure. The experience shifts from uncertainty to
            control. Each step is explained, each decision justified, and each outcome aligned with their
            financial reality. What stands out most is not just approval speed, but the absence of chaos.
            Customers consistently describe the process as calm, transparent, and surprisingly human.
